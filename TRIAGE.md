# Triage guide

How an issue or PR travels from "opened" to "closed", and what every label means.

This is written down for two reasons. Contributors deserve to know why their issue
has the labels it has and roughly when it will be looked at. And triage is one of
the most useful things a non-maintainer can do here — but only if the rules are
public. **You do not need commit access to triage.** Anyone can do most of the
steps below in a comment, and doing it well is a documented route up the
contributor ladder in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md).

## The flow

```
opened ──▶ needs-triage ──▶ accepted (area/* + kind/* + priority/*) ──▶ claimed ──▶ PR ──▶ closed
                │
                ├──▶ needs more info ──▶ (stale after 30d) ──▶ closed, reopenable
                ├──▶ duplicate / invalid / wontfix ──▶ closed with a reason
                └──▶ moved to Discussions (it was a question, not a bug)
```

Every new issue starts as `needs-triage`. Triage means answering five questions:

1. **Is it a question rather than a defect?** → answer it, or point it at
   [Discussions Q&A](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/discussions/categories/q-a),
   then close. Questions are welcome; they are just not issues.
2. **Is it reproducible?** → if the report has no version, no command, and no
   output, ask for the details in [SUPPORT.md § What to include](SUPPORT.md).
   Label `needs-info`.
3. **Which generation?** → bugs against `v1/`–`v3/` are closed as `wontfix` by
   design; those generations are frozen so the published paper stays reproducible.
   Say so kindly and link [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md).
4. **Which area?** → add exactly one `area/*` label (below). This is what makes an
   issue findable by someone who knows that subsystem.
5. **Does it touch the safety model?** → if it touches HITL approval, the mutating
   chokepoint, or RBAC, add `kind/safety`. These get maintainer review regardless
   of size, and are never auto-merged.

Once those are answered, drop `needs-triage` and add `priority/*`.

## Labels and what they actually mean

**`area/*` — which subsystem.** Exactly one per issue.

| Label | Covers |
|---|---|
| `area/server` | `packages/kubeintellect-server` — API, config, core |
| `area/kube-q` | The `kq` CLI and its web terminal |
| `area/agents` | Agents, orchestration, playbooks, prompts |
| `area/detectors` | Detectors, sensorium, PromQL/LogQL signals |
| `area/memory` | Episodes, summaries, temporal knowledge graph |
| `area/deploy` | Helm, Kind, Compose, packaging, install paths |
| `area/eval` | Evaluation harness and benchmarks |

**`kind/*` — what sort of change.** Zero or more.

| Label | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `kind/integration` | A new backend, provider, or observability system |
| `kind/safety` | Touches HITL, RBAC, or the mutating chokepoint — highest review bar |

**`priority/*` — when.** At most one; absence means "normal".

| Label | Meaning in practice |
|---|---|
| `priority/high` | Data loss, a safety-gate bypass, a broken documented install path, or a security fix. Looked at before anything else. |
| _(none)_ | The normal backlog. Ordered by 👍 reactions and by whether a PR exists. |
| `priority/low` | Agreed as desirable, not scheduled. A PR is very welcome and will be reviewed. |

**Contributor-facing labels.**

| Label | Promise attached to it |
|---|---|
| `good first issue` | Self-contained, the file and line are named in the body, and the verification command is written out. If one of these turns out not to be small, that is a bug in the label — say so and it will be relabelled. |
| `help wanted` | The maintainer is not actively working on it and would merge a good PR. |
| `roadmap` | A [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md) item. 👍 reactions on these directly reorder the roadmap. |
| `adoption` | Someone reporting where and how they run KubeIntellect — see [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md). |
| `RFC` | A design proposal. Discuss and reach agreement *before* implementation. |
| `discussion` | Needs community input before anyone should start work. |
| `needs-triage` | Not yet reviewed by a maintainer. Removing this is the triage act. |
| `needs-info` | Waiting on the reporter. Closed after 30 quiet days, and reopened the moment the info arrives. |
| `claimed` | Someone said they are working on it. Pick a different issue. Comes off after two quiet weeks. |

## Claiming an issue

Comment "I'd like to take this." That's it — no permission needed, no assignment
ceremony.

The issue then gets the **`claimed`** label so nobody duplicates your work, and a
reply confirming it is yours. *(GitHub only allows assigning issues to repository
collaborators, so the label — not the assignee field — is what reserves an issue
for an outside contributor. The reservation is exactly as real.)*

If you go quiet for **two weeks** on a claimed issue, the `claimed` label comes off
so someone else can pick it up. This is not a reprimand and you can re-claim it; life
happens, and a silently-blocked issue is worse for you than for the project.

Before starting anything **larger than a `good first issue`**, say what you plan to
do and wait for a 👍. Fifteen minutes of alignment is cheaper than a rewritten PR,
and the maintainer will tell you if there's a design constraint you can't see from
outside.

## What you can expect back

**Every issue and every pull request gets a human first response.** Even when the
answer is "not this way", it arrives rather than silence.

**There is no time commitment attached to that, on purpose.** This is a
single-maintainer volunteer project, and a number written down here that gets
missed during a busy fortnight is worse than no number at all. In practice issues
are usually triaged within a week. If a thread of yours goes quiet, a nudge is
welcome rather than rude — it is a backlog, not a rejection.

## PR review

- CI must be green. `main` requires **nine** checks:

  | Check | Runs locally? |
  |---|---|
  | `Lint (ruff)` · `Types (mypy)` · `Tests (server)` · `Tests (kube-q CLI)` · `File modes` · `Syntax warnings` | ✅ `make setup` runs all six (plus the encoding + roster gates that ride inside `Syntax warnings`) |
  | `Install smoke test` · `Tests (server · py3.13)` · `Tests (kube-q CLI · py3.13)` | ❌ CI only |

  So a green `make setup` covers six of the nine. If your PR is red on one of the
  other three alone, that is a real failure worth reading, not flake. Exact commands
  are in [CONTRIBUTING.md § Quality gates](CONTRIBUTING.md#quality-gates--green-before-you-push).
- `mypy` **is** blocking as of v2.2.0 and the workspace sits at zero errors across
  171 files — if it reports something, it is from your change.
- `ruff format` remains known debt and is **not** a gate; a failure there is not your
  bug. Neither is anything in the `ruff` 0.16 backlog (issue #75) — and please never
  run a bare `ruff check --fix`, because the `UP045` autofix silently disables RBAC
  and the human-in-the-loop gate.
- Review looks at four things, in this order: does it preserve the safety model,
  is it tested, does it fit the design principles, is it documented.
- Commits need nothing signed — no DCO, no CLA.
- A PR that only edits [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md), docs, or a typo gets a fast lane.

### A fork PR looks green but is still blocked

First check whether its workflows have actually run. A first-time fork contribution
can show green `greeting` and `label` jobs while CI is waiting for a maintainer's
approval. Those jobs are not evidence that the required checks passed.

1. Open the PR's merge status panel and look for **Awaiting approval**. Check the
   repository's **Actions** tab for runs belonging to the PR's current head commit,
   including both **CI** and **Publish Helm**. In the workflow-run API, a run awaiting
   approval can have `status: completed` and `conclusion: action_required`;
   `completed` alone does not mean success.
2. A **maintainer with write access** reviews **Files changed**, especially changes
   to `.github/workflows/`, before allowing the proposed code to run. If satisfied,
   use **Approve workflows to run** in the merge status panel (also shown as
   **Approve and run workflows** in some views). This authorizes the workflow run;
   it does not approve the code review or merge the PR. The contributor cannot
   clear this gate and does not need to push an empty commit.
3. Wait for the required checks on the current revision to finish successfully.
   Compare their names with [the required-check record](.github/required-checks.yml)
   and the PR's merge panel. A queued run needs time; a failed job needs its logs
   investigated; an absent required check is not a pass.
4. If all required checks have passed and the PR is still blocked, read the merge
   panel's specific reason: pending review, unresolved conversations, conflicts,
   or another repository requirement. A maintainer can run `make check-required`
   with authenticated `gh` access to compare the recorded checks against live
   branch protection. Investigate the actual requirement before attributing the
   block to CodeQL; do not disable protection or copy the PR onto an integration
   branch just to bypass a workflow-approval wait.

[PR #196](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/196) demonstrated this
distinction: after workflow approval, the cross-repository contribution passed its
checks and merged normally. That supplied the evidence to close
[#170](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/170); it did not require a
code-scanning workaround. See GitHub's
[workflow approval instructions](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/how-tos/manage-workflow-runs/approve-runs-from-forks)
for the current UI steps.

## How things get closed

Closing is a decision with a reason attached, never a silent cleanup:

| Closed as | When |
|---|---|
| **Completed** | A PR merged, with the contributor credited in the release notes. |
| **Duplicate** | Linked to the original, which is where the discussion continues. |
| **Wontfix** | Out of scope — usually something in ROADMAP's "explicitly not planned" table, or a `v1/`–`v3/` bug. The reason is always stated. |
| **Stale** | `needs-info` with no reply for 30 days. Comment on it and it reopens. |
| **Moved** | It was a question or an idea; it now lives in Discussions with a link both ways. |

Disagree with a close? Say so on the issue. Reopening after new information is
normal and nobody has to be persuaded twice.

### Closing several at once — check each one against what actually merged

A batch close is where work gets lost, and it has happened here: a batch on 2026-08-15 closed an
issue whose contribution had **never been merged**, and nobody noticed until 09-08, when it was
recovered by cherry-pick. Every green check had passed; the batch was simply wrong about what was
in `main`.

So when closing more than one issue in a sitting, the rule is per-issue and mechanical:

- **Verify the merge, do not infer it.** For each issue closed as *Completed*, confirm the commit
  is on `main` — `git log origin/main --oneline --grep '#<issue>'`, or open the linked PR and
  check it says *Merged*, not *Closed*. A closed-unmerged PR looks nearly identical in a list view.
- **Read `origin/main`, not the working tree.** A stale checkout makes merged work look missing
  and missing work look merged; `make check-roster` passes green in a stale tree.
- **If the scope moved, say so on the issue** rather than letting the close imply it shipped.

The cost of skipping this is not a tidy tracker — it is a contributor whose work silently
vanished, which is the one outcome this project treats as unacceptable.

## Want to help with triage?

Pick any issue labelled
[`needs-triage`](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/labels/needs-triage)
and post a comment that answers the five questions at the top. Try to reproduce it
and say what happened. That is genuinely one of the highest-leverage contributions
available here, it needs no repo permissions, and it is credited in release notes
exactly like code is.
