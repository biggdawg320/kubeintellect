---

KubeIntellect is an open-source, LLM-orchestrated multi-agent framework for **autonomous Kubernetes operations**. Ask a question in plain English — it fans out to specialized agents that query **kubectl**, **Prometheus** (PromQL), and **Loki** (LogQL) live, correlates the evidence, and answers. Any change to the cluster pauses for **explicit human-in-the-loop approval** with role-based access control.

```bash
kq -q "why is my api-server pod crashlooping?"
kq -q "show me pods with high restart counts in the default namespace"
kq -q "scale the frontend deployment to 5 replicas"   # pauses for your approval
```

> **Safe by default** — read-only queries run immediately; scale, delete, and restart operations require explicit approval before anything executes.

## What is KubeIntellect?

- **KubeIntellect is an open-source framework for conversational, natural-language Kubernetes operations** — root-cause analysis, live diagnostics, and human-approved cluster actions.
- **It is for** platform engineers, DevOps engineers, SREs, and Kubernetes operators who want to troubleshoot and manage clusters in plain English.
- **It helps you diagnose incidents faster** by correlating kubectl state, Prometheus metrics, and Loki logs through a coordinator that delegates to pod, metrics, logs, and events subagents.
- **Use KubeIntellect when** you want conversational operations with a hard safety gate on every destructive action.
- **It is different from read-only AI diagnostics tools** because it can also *act* — scale, restart, delete — but only after explicit human approval, gated by RBAC (admin / operator / readonly).
- **It is not** a replacement for your observability stack, a GitOps/CD pipeline, or on-call judgment; it queries the tools you already run and pauses before changing anything. It requires an OpenAI or Azure OpenAI API key and Python 3.12+.

## Quick start

**Try it in your browser — zero install.** Open **[kubeintellect.com/demo](https://kubeintellect.com/demo)**
or the **[🤗 Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/spaces/mskazemi/kubeintellect)** (both read-only, same shared demo cluster).

**Install the CLI (read-only, one `pip install`):**

```bash
pip install kube-q
kq --api-key ki-ro-dev            # kq defaults to https://api.kubeintellect.com
```

**Run the server from the container image** (Docker is the only prerequisite):

```bash
docker run --rm -p 8000:8000 \
  -e LLM_PROVIDER=openai -e OPENAI_API_KEY=sk-... -e USE_SQLITE=true \
  ghcr.io/mskazemi/kubeintellect:2.4.1
curl localhost:8000/healthz          # {"status":"ok","arm":"v4",...}
```

The same image is also mirrored to Docker Hub as `kazemi/kubeintellect:2.4.1`, if you'd rather
not use GHCR. Both carry a sigstore build-provenance attestation and an SBOM, and you can check
them before you run anything — see
**[what is signed, and how to check it](v4/docs/security.md#what-is-signed-and-how-to-check-it)**.

That starts the API with no database and no cluster attached — enough to see it come up.
To point it at a cluster and a real database, use
**[Docker Compose](v4/README.md#docker-compose-laptop--vm---no-cluster-required-to-run-the-server)**.

Or install the server from PyPI:

```bash
pip install kubeintellect
kubeintellect init         # setup wizard — writes ~/.kubeintellect/.env
kubeintellect kind-setup   # optional: create a local Kind cluster to try it against
kubeintellect serve        # start the API server on :8000
```

Full install paths (browser, CLI-only, local Kind, Docker Compose, existing cluster) are in the **[v4 README](v4/README.md)** and **[v4 docs](v4/docs/)**.

**Who's actually running this?** One real adopter so far, honestly listed in
[ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md) — if you're running KubeIntellect anywhere, even a laptop Kind
cluster, you'd be the second entry.

## This repository

This repo holds **multiple generations** of KubeIntellect. Each generation is a self-contained re-architecture of the same product — together they trace one design lineage from a capability-maximal multi-agent system to a lean, measurable, human-governed operator.

| Version | What it is | Status |
|---|---|---|
| **[`v4/`](v4/)** | **Platform (recommended).** The lean coordinator plus feature-flagged layers: sensorium + detector engine, memory hierarchy (episodes + temporal knowledge graph), flight recorder, autonomy ladder, and predictive detection. Shipped as a `uv` monorepo (`kubeintellect-server`, `kube-q`, `ki-protocol`). | **Current** |
| **[`v2/`](v2/)** | **Lean baseline.** A single LangGraph coordinator ReAct loop over 4 guarded tools (`run_kubectl`, `run_helm`, `query_prometheus`, `query_loki`) with a 7-layer kubectl safety guard, on-demand 4-subagent RCA, and an evaluation harness. | Baseline |
| **[`v3/`](v3/)** | **Framework-delegated.** The v2 behavior expressed through the [`deepagents`](https://github.com/langchain-ai/deepagents) framework — coordinator + sub-agents over a virtual filesystem with planning and task delegation. | Experimental |
| **[`v1/`](v1/)** | **Capability-maximal origin.** LangGraph supervisor + 13 specialized ReAct agents, runtime tool synthesis, ~100+ Kubernetes tools, multi-provider LLM support. The original published architecture. | Legacy |

**New here? Start with [`v4/`](v4/)** — it's the current implementation. `v1/` is the architecture described in the published paper (see [Citation](#citation)).

> **Lineage:** v1 (capability-maximal) → *simplify* → v2 (lean, measurable) → *reframe* → v3 (framework-delegated) → *productionize* → v4 (platform).

## Repository layout

Responsibilities are split between the repo root and each version directory:

- **Root — `Makefile` + `deploy/` + `scripts/`** manages the *shared infrastructure* every version runs against: one Kind cluster, one observability stack (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki), and one Langfuse instance with a shared project. Run `make help` at the root to list the infra targets.
- **Per-version — `v4/Makefile`, etc.** each version directory has its own Makefile for *application* build/deploy and Python development, plus its own `docs/`, `tests/`, and packaging.

Every top-level directory, and what it is for:

| Directory | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `v1/` `v2/` `v3/` `v4/` | The four generations — see the table above. `v4/` is the one to run. |
| `deploy/` | Shared-infrastructure manifests and charts: the Kind cluster, the Prometheus/Grafana/Loki stack, and Langfuse. Driven by the root `Makefile`, not by any single version. |
| `scripts/` | Repo-wide helper scripts, including the two CI gates that need no virtualenv — `check-file-modes.sh` and `check-syntax-warnings.py`. |
| `snap/` | `snapcraft.yaml` for the Snap Store package. Built by `.github/workflows/snap.yml`; publishing runs only from the canonical public repo. |

Anything not listed here is not part of the published repository.

## Shared infrastructure

All versions run against one shared infrastructure stack rather than each standing up its own:

- **One Kind cluster** — `make kind-cluster-create`
- **One observability stack** (Prometheus + Grafana + Loki) — `make monitoring-install`
- **One Langfuse instance + shared project** — `make langfuse-provision`, then `make langfuse-install`
- **Local hosts entry** — `make hosts-entry`

`make langfuse-provision` auto-creates a shared Langfuse project and token and fans the keys into each version's `.env` (no manual UI step). All versions share **one** Langfuse project; per-version cost is filtered by a `version:vN` trace tag.

### Quick start (laptop + Kind)

From the repository root:

```bash
make kind-cluster-create     # one shared Kind cluster
make monitoring-install      # Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
make langfuse-provision      # create shared Langfuse project + token, fan keys into each .env
make langfuse-install        # deploy Langfuse
make hosts-entry             # add local hosts entry
```

Then build and deploy a version's application:

```bash
cd v4
make kind-build-kubeintellect
make kind-deploy-kubeintellect
```

Run `make help` at the root at any time to see the available infra targets.

## Documentation

- **[Website](https://kubeintellect.com/)** — overview, live demo, and hosted API.
- **[v4 docs](v4/docs/)** — install, quickstart, configuration, architecture, security, CLI reference, and troubleshooting for the current version.
- **[Data handling](v4/docs/data-handling.md)** — what v4 sends to model and telemetry endpoints, stores, and redacts.
- **[v4 README](v4/README.md)** — every install path in detail.
- Each version directory (`v1/`–`v4/`) ships its own `README.md` and `docs/`.

## Use cases

- **Incident response** — "why is this pod crashlooping?" correlates events, logs, and metrics into a root-cause answer.
- **Interactive diagnostics** — explore cluster state, restart counts, resource pressure, and PromQL/LogQL results conversationally.
- **Guarded operations** — scale, restart, and delete with an explicit approval gate and RBAC, so an LLM never acts unilaterally.
- **Learning & practice** — the `init` wizard can deploy broken-pod RCA scenarios to practice against.

## How it compares

| | KubeIntellect | Read-only AI diagnostics (e.g. k8sgpt) | Raw `kubectl` + dashboards |
|---|---|---|---|
| Natural-language Q&A | ✅ | ✅ | ❌ |
| Correlates kubectl + Prometheus + Loki | ✅ | Partial | Manual |
| Performs cluster actions | ✅ (approval-gated) | ❌ | ✅ (unguarded) |
| Human-in-the-loop safety gate + RBAC | ✅ | n/a | ❌ |
| Works with no LLM API key | ❌ | Varies (local models supported) | ✅ |
| Runs fully offline / air-gapped | Partial (self-hosted models only) | Varies | ✅ |
| Per-query cost | LLM tokens | LLM tokens | Free |
| Project maturity & community size | Young — small community | **Larger, more adopted** | Universal |

Where the alternatives win is stated on purpose: if you only need read-only
triage, or you cannot send cluster data to a hosted model, a read-only tool or
plain `kubectl` may be the better fit. KubeIntellect earns its cost when you want
conversational diagnosis *and* guarded action in one loop.

## Limitations

Known and deliberate, so you can judge fit before installing:

- **An LLM API key is required.** OpenAI or Azure OpenAI out of the box; v4 also
  supports Anthropic, Qwen, and OpenAI-compatible endpoints. Queries cost tokens.
- **Cluster context leaves your network** unless you point it at a self-hosted or
  in-cluster model endpoint. Review [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) and the
  [data-handling notes](v4/docs/data-handling.md) before running it against
  production.
- **It is not a replacement** for your observability stack, a GitOps/CD pipeline,
  or on-call judgment. It queries the tools you already run.
- **LLM answers can be wrong.** The approval gate exists precisely because the
  model's proposed action should be read before it runs. Do not enable
  `--auto-approve` outside testing.
- **Autonomy is capped at A1 by default** — detector firings open investigations;
  automatic remediation (A3) requires an explicit allowlist.
- **Young project.** APIs across `v1/`–`v4/` have changed between generations;
  `v4/` is the supported line and the one to build on.

## FAQ

**Does it change my cluster automatically?** No. Read-only queries run immediately; any mutating action (scale/restart/delete) pauses for explicit human approval, subject to RBAC.

**What LLM providers are supported?** OpenAI and Azure OpenAI out of the box (v4 also supports additional providers via configuration). An API key is required.

**Do I need a cluster to try it?** No — use the [browser demo](https://kubeintellect.com/demo) or the read-only `kube-q` CLI. For full features, `kubeintellect init` creates a local Kind cluster for you.

**Which version should I use?** [`v4/`](v4/) — it's the current, actively developed implementation.

## Contributing

**Contributions are wanted, and the barrier is deliberately low.** You do **not** need a
Kubernetes cluster, a Docker daemon, or an LLM API key to contribute — the test suites are
fully mocked. Python 3.12+ is the only prerequisite.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect.git
cd kubeintellect
make setup     # installs the v4 workspace, then runs the exact gates CI runs (~1 min)
```

`make setup` ends by telling you whether your environment is correct, so you never debug your
setup and your change at the same time. Prefer zero install? Open the repo in a
[**GitHub Codespace**](https://codespaces.new/MSKazemi/kubeintellect) — `.devcontainer/` runs
the same setup for you.

**What you can expect back:** every issue and PR gets a *human* first response — even if the
answer is "not this way", it arrives rather than silence ([TRIAGE.md](TRIAGE.md)). Every merged
contributor is named in the release notes. And one thing that will look broken but isn't —
**on a first-time contributor's fork PR,
GitHub runs no CI until a maintainer approves the run**, so your PR sits with no checks. That is
expected, it is not your mistake, and you do not need to do anything.

## Maintainer

KubeIntellect was created by **[Mohsen Seyedkazemi Ardebili](https://github.com/MSKazemi)**, who
maintains it today — see [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md). The shipped code is the work of the
people named below as well, and that list is meant to grow.

Where the project is going — and what it deliberately **won't** do — is in **[ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md)**. It has one maintainer today; the contributor ladder in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) is a real invitation, not a formality, and areas are genuinely available to own.

If KubeIntellect is useful to you, a ⭐ helps other people find it — and [#51](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/51) is where to say what you're using it for.

### Contributors

Everyone other than the maintainer who has moved this project forward. **A merged commit is
not the entry fee** — a bug report, a platform verification, a review, an argument that changed
a design decision, or work that is in progress right now all count, and several people below
have no merged commit at all. Rows grow as people do more; nobody is ever removed.

The list is short because the project is young — which is exactly why being on it is worth
something.

| | Contributed |
|---|---|
| **[@hariomlohardev](https://github.com/hariomlohardev)** | Removed the executable bit from 94 non-script modules ([#70](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/70)) — mode-only, zero content lines, and it fixed the cause rather than silencing the rule. Also [#57](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/57) and [#65](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/65). Cleared three ruff-0.16 rule families ([#110](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/110)) without touching `UP045`, the one whose autofix would have disabled RBAC and the HITL gate. Wrote the `DeploymentRolloutStuck` playbook ([#112](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/112)) — the first to route to downstream playbooks instead of duplicating them, and the first with an `expected_evidence` entry naming when it does **not** apply. Then took on the whole `kq` cookbook gap in one sitting — worked examples for the eight undocumented subcommands ([#119](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/119)–[#126](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/126)), every transcript real and re-verified byte-for-byte against `kube-q` 1.5.0 — plus the `PvcPending` and `LivenessProbeFailing` playbooks ([#127](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/127), [#128](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/128)), the `.env.example` restore ([#117](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/117)) — where he found the live cause, a `.gitignore` pattern, rather than the one the issue blamed — and the Homebrew style pass ([#118](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/118)). |
| **[@AdvaitVarhade](https://github.com/AdvaitVarhade)** | Fixed the demo UI's `set-state-in-effect` errors ([#73](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/73)) — and corrected the issue itself, which had named the wrong file. Also proposed the `kq export` command and reported the Python 3.13 syntax warnings. |
| **[@shaurya703](https://github.com/shaurya703)** | Repointed the PyPI metadata at the canonical repository and adopted PEP 639 ([#78](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/78)) — noticing that `license-files` resolves per package, which meant two wheels had been shipping **without the AGPL text at all**. Spotted the same defect in `mkdocs.yml`, which led to a 13-file sweep. Also cleared the `I001` import backlog ([#77](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/77)). Then closed the `#136`/`#156` encoding class outright ([#161](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/161)) — 62 call sites named an encoding, deliberately including the tests and probes, because a gate that exempts the places nobody looks is where this bug survived in the first place — and left behind `scripts/check-text-encoding.py` so it cannot come back. Stdlib-only and independent of ruff, so the `<0.16` pin's blind spot cannot reach it. |
| **[@uuzzrm](https://github.com/uuzzrm)** | Wrote [`v4/docs/data-handling.md`](v4/docs/data-handling.md) ([#105](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/105)) — the page that states what reaches a model provider, what is persisted, and precisely where the redactor does **not** apply. Every claim in it was verified against source. Their honest test-failure report also uncovered [#106](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/106), a real environment-sensitivity bug in our own suite. Also fixed the Homebrew formula ([#111](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/111)) — which declared MIT on AGPL code — and reported plainly that they could not run `brew` rather than passing static checks off as an install test. Later made the memory recall similarity floor configurable ([#116](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/116)) — one setting replacing the same constant hard-coded independently in two recall modules, with tests that pin the default and prove the override reaches both paths. It merged unchanged. Then two fixes in one week that both arrived with real regression tests: playbook YAML read as UTF-8 ([#138](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/138)) — on a non-UTF-8 locale the loader's per-file `except` swallowed a `UnicodeDecodeError` and the server came up with **zero** playbooks and nothing that looked like a failure — and a bounded repair loop for triage JSON ([#133](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/133)), so one malformed model reply no longer silently converts a chat question into a full cluster investigation. |
| **[@ybayraktarb](https://github.com/ybayraktarb)** | First to answer a **no-code verification** issue end to end ([#100](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/100)) — ran the documented install path on k3s/k3d (macOS, OrbStack), a platform CI does not cover, and reported what actually happened rather than that it worked. Independently confirmed that a `readonly` key blocks a mutating operation **before** the HITL prompt, which until then only our own tests asserted. The run also surfaced that the README quickstart had never worked — `kq "question"` reads the first positional as a subcommand — and the fix and the first [ADOPTERS.md](ADOPTERS.md) entry came as one PR ([#151](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/151)). |
| **[@floze-the-genius](https://github.com/floze-the-genius)** | Made the `kq` suite independent of the terminal it runs in ([#109](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/109)) — tests used to fail on a narrow or `NO_COLOR` terminal before a contributor changed anything. Pinned the environment in `pytest_configure`, **before** module import, which is what a fixture alone cannot do, and **without weakening a single assertion**. Reported a five-environment before/after matrix in which every number reproduced independently. |
| **[@Priyanshu608](https://github.com/Priyanshu608)** | Wrote the `NetworkPolicyBlocking` playbook ([#108](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/108)) — the 19th, and the only one whose signal is the **absence** of evidence: a policy denial is dropped in the CNI datapath, so no event is ever emitted and the connection simply hangs. Captured that as a positive finding rather than a gap. |
| **[@Chris7717](https://github.com/Chris7717)** | Wrote the `HPANotScaling` playbook ([#114](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/114)) — reproduced **both** root causes on a real kind cluster (metrics-server unreachable, and a container with no `resources.requests.cpu`) and took the investigation steps and expected evidence from actual `kubectl` output rather than inventing them. Also filed [#115](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/115): a clone had no `.env.example` although the docs, README and Makefile all told you to copy it. The report pointed straight at the right file, and chasing it down found the live cause — `.gitignore`'s `.env.*` glob matches `.env.example` too, so the template could not be committed back at all. |
| **[@AshSgDe29071999](https://github.com/AshSgDe29071999)** | Independently diagnosed the terminal-sensitivity bug and submitted the fixture-only fix ([#107](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/107)). It did not merge — #109 arrived against a claimed issue — but running it as a control is the only reason we know the `pytest_configure` hook is load-bearing rather than incidental. The `claimed` label exists because of the collision they hit. |
| **[@be-student](https://github.com/be-student)** | Fixed the fault-isolation hole in parallel tool batches ([#183](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/183), closing [#174](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/174)) — one malformed `kubectl` call raised straight out of LangGraph's parallel `ToolNode` and discarded every *successful* investigation result in the same batch, so a six-command diagnosis returned nothing. They found the right seam (`awrap_tool_call`) rather than widening a `try` around the graph, and the regression builds a **real compiled LangGraph** with seven parallel calls and proves the six good results survive — a test that genuinely fails without the fix. They also kept the HITL interrupt escaping the boundary unchanged and put both the command and the failure reason through `redact_secrets`, which is the part most fault-isolation patches get wrong. |
| **[@biggdawg320](https://github.com/biggdawg320)** | Wrote the `PodDisruptionBudgetBlocking` playbook ([#196](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/196)) — a voluntary eviction refused by a PDB, which is one of the harder Kubernetes failures to diagnose because nothing looks broken. Two judgement calls stand out. They kept `detect: null` and said why: an eviction refusal is an API response or drain stderr, not a Warning Event, and Karpenter reports PDB blockers as **Normal** events — so there was nothing honest to compile into a watch predicate. And they encoded that **zero allowed disruptions is legitimate availability policy, not an incident**, with a negative test proving a `kubectl get pdb` table showing `0` does not fire the playbook. The fix template refuses to delete the PDB or reach for `drain --disable-eviction`. They also added read-only `policy/poddisruptionbudgets` to both shipped roles and extended the RBAC-coverage test that derives its list from the playbooks. Reported their validation honestly, explicitly **not** claiming full suites green and running the unchanged base as a control to separate their changes from pre-existing Windows failures. Then wrote the fork-PR section of [`TRIAGE.md`](TRIAGE.md) ([#198](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/198)), which records the trap that a workflow run awaiting maintainer approval reports `status: completed` with `conclusion: action_required` — so `completed` alone does not mean success — and separates workflow approval from code-review approval, the conflation that produced [#170](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/170). And a third: `StatefulSetRolloutStuck` ([#202](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/202)), where they assessed the scope **before** claiming it and correctly argued that no snapshot signal distinguishes a normal rollout wait from a stalled one — so the triggers match only the StatefulSet controller's own creation-failure messages, checked against `stateful_pod_control.go` rather than invented, with a multi-line negative test proving a `successful` line for one object cannot pair with a `failed error:` from another. They ran the red-green themselves and reported both halves (3 failed before the YAML, 14 passing after). |
| **[@1cbyc](https://github.com/1cbyc)** | Claimed the `subprocess.run(..., text=True)` encoding work ([#168](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/168)) — and **changed the plan before writing a line of code**. The issue recorded the maintainer's inclination as *"`errors="replace"` on log/output reads and strict elsewhere"*; they argued the line belongs somewhere better: strict `utf-8` for identifiers and structured command output, because replacement can turn operational data into a **plausible wrong answer**, and `errors="replace"` only where the purpose is displaying free-form logs. That is the reasoning this project exists to protect, it is now the adopted policy, and it arrived from someone who had not yet touched the repo. They also scoped themselves — 17 shipping call sites, not a bulk rewrite — and asked for confirmation before editing. |
| **[@Ryota-Di](https://github.com/Ryota-Di)** | Stepped forward for [#189](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/189) — `kubeintellect service start` exiting 0 when systemd refuses to start the unit — within an hour of it being filed, and asked to be assigned rather than working in silence, which is the thing that stops two people duplicating an evening. Work in progress. |
| **[@Lumbenlengo](https://github.com/Lumbenlengo)** | Volunteered to verify the install path on **Amazon EKS** ([#101](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/101)) — the most common managed platform in production, and one CI has never touched, so IRSA, the AWS VPC CNI and the load-balancer controller are all genuinely unknown territory for this project. Offered a non-production cluster of their own to find out. Work in progress. |

Every merged contribution is credited by name in [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) and in the
release notes.

**Non-code work is credited as a first-class contribution type.** The project follows the
[All Contributors](https://allcontributors.org/) specification (`.all-contributorsrc`), so
documentation, bug reports, reviews, ideas, triage, and **verifying KubeIntellect on a
Kubernetes platform our CI does not cover** are all recorded — not just merged commits.

**Your name goes up when you start, not when you merge.** Claim an issue and you are added to
the table that day, marked 🛠️ as in progress, with a row saying what you took on. When the work
lands the row is rewritten to say what you did. If it does not land — you ran out of time, the
cluster went away, life happened — **the row stays**, because deciding to help is a real thing
that happened and pretending otherwise is how projects teach people not to volunteer. Nobody is
ever removed from this table.

That last one is a real, open lane: CI runs on Kind only, so nobody has confirmed the install
path on **k3s, EKS, GKE, AKS or OpenShift**. Those issues need a cluster and about an hour, and
**no Python at all** — see
[`area/deploy`](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3Aarea%2Fdeploy).
A report saying *"it did not work, here is exactly where it stopped"* is the single most useful
thing the project cannot get any other way.

> **One honest caveat.** GitHub's Contributors graph counts *merged commits* only, so a comment
> or a platform report will not appear there however valuable it is. If you want to be on that
> graph too, the one-line docs PR that comes out of what you found will do it — and is usually
> warranted anyway. See [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md) for the full ladder.

## Also from the maintainer

Two other open-source projects, both of which welcome contributors on exactly the same terms as
this one — and if you have contributed here, you already know how they are run.

- **[YazSes](https://github.com/MSKazemi/yazses)** — offline voice dictation for Linux, macOS
  and Windows. Hold a key, speak, release; speech-to-text runs on your own CPU and nothing is
  sent to a server. Apache-2.0, and [good first issues are tagged and
  waiting](https://github.com/MSKazemi/yazses/issues?q=is%3Aopen+label%3A%22good+first+issue%22).
- **[AOBench](https://github.com/MSKazemi/aobench)** — role-aware, permission-enforced
  benchmark for LLM agents operating HPC systems. A policy violation hard-fails the task,
  however correct the answer looked.
