# Contributing to KubeIntellect

First off — **thank you.** KubeIntellect is an open-source, human-governed AI SRE for
Kubernetes, and it gets better every time someone files a bug, sharpens a doc, or ships a
feature. This guide gets you from clone to merged PR.

## This is a multi-generation monorepo

The repo holds several generations of the same product (`v1/` → `v4/`), each a self-contained
re-architecture. **`v4/` is the current, actively developed version — start there.** `v1/` is
the architecture described in the [published paper](https://doi.org/10.1007/s10723-026-09837-6)
and is frozen; please don't send behavioral changes to `v1/`–`v3/` unless an issue explicitly asks.

| Version | Role | Contributions welcome? |
|---|---|---|
| **`v4/`** | Current platform | ✅ Yes — this is where active work happens |
| `v3/`, `v2/` | Baseline / experimental lineage | 🔸 Bug fixes & docs only |
| `v1/` | Published, legacy | ❄️ Frozen — docs/typos only |

The repo **root** (`Makefile`, `deploy/`, `scripts/`) manages the *shared infrastructure*
(one Kind cluster, one observability stack, one Langfuse). Each version directory owns its own
*application* build, tests, and docs.

## Dev setup

### Fastest path — one command

**You do not need a Kubernetes cluster, an LLM API key, or Docker to contribute.** The test
suites are fully mocked. Only Python 3.12+ is required.

```bash
# Canonical repo.
git clone https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect.git
cd kubeintellect
make setup          # or: ./scripts/dev-setup.sh
```

That installs [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) if missing, installs the whole `v4`
workspace, and then runs **the exact eight gates CI runs** (ruff, mypy, both test suites, file
modes, syntax warnings, text encoding, contributor roster) so you know your environment is correct before you change anything. It
takes about a minute and prints what to do next.

**Zero-install alternative:** open the repo in a
[GitHub Codespace](https://codespaces.new/MSKazemi/kubeintellect) or in VS Code with the Dev
Containers extension — `.devcontainer/devcontainer.json` runs the same setup automatically.

### Manual path

**Requirements:** Python **3.12+**, [`uv`](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/getting-started/installation/).
Docker, [`kind`](https://kind.sigs.k8s.io/), `kubectl` and `helm` are needed **only** for
end-to-end work against a real cluster.

```bash
cd kubeintellect/v4

cp .env.example .env      # only needed to RUN the app; not needed to run the tests
uv sync                    # install the workspace (kubeintellect-server, kube-q, ki-protocol)
```

Most tests mock the Kubernetes client and LLM, so you can develop and run the suite
**without a cluster**. For end-to-end work against a real cluster, bring up the shared infra
from the repo root:

```bash
make kind-cluster-create     # one shared Kind cluster
make monitoring-install      # Prometheus + Grafana + Loki
make langfuse-provision      # shared Langfuse project + token
```

See the [v4 README](v4/README.md) for every install path in detail.

## The contribution workflow

1. **Find or open an issue first.** For anything larger than a typo, comment on the issue (or
   open one) so we can align on approach before you invest time. For big changes, open an
   [RFC](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/new/choose) or a
   [Discussion](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/discussions) first.
2. **Fork & branch.** Branch from `main`: `git checkout -b fix/pod-log-truncation`.
3. **Write the change *and its tests* in one pass.** Every code change ships with tests.
4. **Run the gates locally** (below) — green before you push.
5. **Open a PR** using the template. Link the issue (`Closes #123`), describe the *why*.
   There is nothing to sign — no CLA, no sign-off line.

How issues get labelled, prioritised, assigned, and closed is written down in
[TRIAGE.md](TRIAGE.md) — including how to claim an issue and what "quiet for two
weeks" means.

## Your first PR, start to finish

Pick anything from the
[**good first issue**](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/labels/good%20first%20issue)
label — the loop below is identical for all of them. This walkthrough uses the one that
never runs out: [**#13 — add a failure playbook**](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/13).
A playbook is a single YAML file. No Python, no cluster, no LLM key, and the library is
*meant* to keep growing, so this issue stays open by design.

**1. Claim it.** Comment "I'd like to take this" on the issue. No permission needed.

**2. Fork and clone.**

```bash
gh repo fork MSKazemi/kubeintellect --clone   # or fork in the UI, then git clone
cd kubeintellect
git checkout -b feat/playbook-dns-resolution
```

**3. Set up just enough to run the gates.** You do **not** need a Kubernetes
cluster, a Docker daemon, or an LLM API key to run the test suite — almost
everything is mocked.

```bash
cd v4
uv sync            # ~1 min; installs the three workspace packages
```

**4. Write the playbook.** One file in
`packages/kubeintellect-server/app/agent/playbooks/`, named after the failure. The
schema — and the rule for when to use `detect: null` — is in
[docs/agent-behaviors.md](v4/docs/agent-behaviors.md#playbook-library). Copy the
closest existing playbook and edit it; that is the fastest correct start.

**5. Prove it loads**, before anything else. A playbook that fails to parse is silently
skipped, so check the loader actually picked it up:

```bash
uv run python -c "from app.agent.playbooks.loader import list_playbooks; print(len(list(list_playbooks())))"
```

**6. Run the gates** (the section below has the exact commands). For a playbook, the
suite plus `ruff check` is enough.

**7. Update the numbers — the one step that surprises people.** The playbook count is
stated in **eight** sentences across five docs, and a gate fails the PR if any of them
disagrees with the code. You do not have to find them by hand:

```bash
make docs-fix      # rewrites every drifted count, then re-checks
```

Commit the doc changes it makes along with your playbook. If you skip this, CI fails
with `Doc-claims drift detected` and a list of the exact files — that is this step,
not a problem with your playbook.

**8. Commit and push.** There is nothing to sign off — no `-s`, no trailer, and no check
looking for one.

```bash
git commit -m "feat(playbooks): add in-cluster DNS resolution failure playbook"
git push -u origin feat/playbook-dns-resolution
```

**9. Open the PR.**

```bash
gh pr create --fill --body "Closes #13"
```

Fill in the template, say *why* in one or two sentences, and mention if you used AI
assistance (see below — it is welcome, just disclosed).

**10. Expect a reply, not silence.** Every PR gets a first response, even if the
answer is "not this way". If CI fails on something unrelated to your change, say so
in the PR — pre-existing `ruff format` debt is not your bug.

**Stuck at any step?** That is a documentation defect, not a you problem — say so in
[Discussions](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/discussions/categories/q-a)
and this section gets fixed.

## Quality gates — green before you push

These are the **exact** commands CI runs
([`.github/workflows/ci.yml`](.github/workflows/ci.yml)). Run them from `v4/`:

```bash
uv sync                                                        # once, after cloning

# 1. Lint — the CI gate is `ruff check` only (not `ruff format`; see the note below)
uv run ruff check packages/kubeintellect-server/app/ packages/ki-protocol/

# 2. Types — must stay at zero errors
uv run mypy packages/kubeintellect-server/app packages/ki-protocol packages/kube-q/kube_q

# 3. Tests — two suites, run separately: the two `tests` packages collide
#    under a single pytest invocation.
uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q                              # server (~5584 tests)
cd packages/kube-q && uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q        # kq CLI (~749 tests)
```

If you are fixing a bug in a frozen arm, run that arm's own suite too — it resolves from its
own lockfile, not the v4 workspace, so it needs its own sync:

```bash
cd v2 && uv sync && uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q   # ~259 tests, 5 skipped
cd v3 && uv sync && uv run python -m pytest tests/ -q   # ~154 tests
```

The five skips in v2 are expected. Those modules test `evaluation/`, the offline scoring
harness behind the campaign numbers in the papers; it is not part of this repository, so they
skip with a reason rather than failing. Nothing you can change in `v2/` will unskip them.

CI runs the two v4 test suites **twice** — on Python 3.12 and on Python 3.13. 3.13 is not
optional coverage: `v4/Dockerfile`'s runtime stage is `python:3.13-slim`, so it is the
interpreter the shipped container executes. If your change passes on one and fails on the
other, that difference is the bug.

There are two more gates, run from the **repo root**. Both need no virtualenv and take a
second:

```bash
make check-modes    # a tracked file is executable if and only if it has a shebang
make fix-modes      # corrects any violation in place, then re-check

make check-syntax   # every tracked .py compiles with no SyntaxWarning
```

Each prints how many files it actually examined, and a run that examines nothing fails
rather than passing. Both also state their own shortfall rather than leaving you to spot a
suspiciously low count. The syntax gate lists every path it could not open on stderr and
carries `(N of M skipped, see above)` in its verdict line; the mode gate prints
`note: N tracked path(s) were skipped` above **every** verdict it can reach — the clean one,
the violation report, and `--fix`. Skipping is not an error — a hook that passes a
just-deleted path is doing the right thing, so the exit code is unaffected — but a count is
only a coverage claim when the denominator is stated beside it, and that is as true of a run
that found violations as of one that did not.

Both exist to cover blind spots the main gates structurally cannot see. `ruff` is pinned
`<0.16` here, and `EXE002` ("executable file with no shebang") only became a default rule in
0.16 — so the lint gate cannot see a stray `+x` bit at all. That blind spot is how 94 library
modules ended up marked executable before
[#70](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/pull/70) cleared them. In practice this only
affects you if you add a new file: leave it non-executable unless it is a script with a shebang.

The syntax gate is the same story for invalid escape sequences (`"\d"` where you meant
`r"\d"`). The pinned `ruff` does not report them in the linted scope, `mypy` never compiles
source, and `pytest` only raises the warning on a cold `.pyc` cache — so a green suite proved
nothing, and [#63](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect/issues/63) reached an outside
contributor. It was not cosmetic either: the same string was corrupting the jsonpath examples
in the coordinator prompt. Fix the string; never silence the warning.

A PR that fails these will fail CI. If a gate is failing for a reason unrelated to your change,
say so in the PR.

> `make lint` in `v4/` also runs `ruff format --check`, which currently fails on pre-existing
> formatting. That is **not** a CI gate — use the `ruff check` command above to predict CI.

### PR checklist

- [ ] Change is scoped to `v4/` (or a version whose contributions are open)
- [ ] New behavior has both a happy-path **and** an error-path test
- [ ] **Every write/mutating operation keeps its dry-run + diff + human-approval (HITL) gate** — this is a safety requirement, not a UX choice
- [ ] Secret values are never logged or returned (key names only)
- [ ] `pytest`, `ruff check` and `mypy` pass locally (these are the CI gates)
- [ ] `make check-modes` passes (only relevant if you added a file)
- [ ] `make check-syntax` passes (no `SyntaxWarning` on the newest supported interpreter)
- [ ] Docs updated if behavior/CLI/flags changed

> **On `mypy`:** it is now a blocking gate and the workspace sits at **zero errors** — if it
> reports something, it is from your change. Two annotations are load-bearing and mypy cannot
> see why: LangGraph and LangChain both decide whether to inject the run config by
> *pattern-matching the `config` parameter's annotation*, so respelling it silently disables
> RBAC and the HITL gate. `tests/test_workflow_config_injection.py` guards this — if it fails,
> read its docstring before changing an annotation.
>
> **On `ruff format`:** still **not** a gate — it would reformat ~108 files, which needs to land
> as its own commit. Tracked in [ROADMAP.md](ROADMAP.md). You are not expected to fix that in
> your PR. If a gate fails for a reason unrelated to your change, say so in the PR; it is not
> your bug.

## AI assistance

**AI assistance is welcome.** This project is itself an AI tool; it would be strange to ban the
tooling. What matters is not how a change was produced but whether you stand behind it.

Regardless of how you wrote it, you must:

- **Understand it** — every line, well enough to explain the approach in review.
- **Have run the tests locally**, and read the output.
- **Take responsibility for it** as your own work.

Please **disclose substantial AI assistance** in the PR description. This is not a black mark;
it just helps reviewers know where to look, exactly like "I copied this pattern from the
Kubernetes docs" would.

Two specific asks for this project in particular:

1. **Never let a generated change weaken the safety model.** The HITL approval gate, the RBAC
   checks, and the mutating chokepoint are load-bearing. A plausible-looking refactor that
   quietly bypasses them is the single most dangerous PR we could merge, and it is exactly the
   kind of thing generated code does confidently.
2. **Don't open a PR you can't defend.** We review on the merits, and "why this approach rather
   than X?" is a normal question. If you can answer it, the PR is fine — that's the whole
   filter, and it applies identically to hand-written code.

We will never reject a contribution *because* AI was used. We will reject one that is untested,
doesn't fit the design, or that the author cannot explain — the same bar as always.

## Design principles (read before adding agents/tools)

KubeIntellect earns every layer of complexity. Two rules that PRs are held to:

- **If a capability can be a new *tool* on an existing agent, don't make it a new *agent*.**
- **Every mutating action must pause for explicit human approval, gated by RBAC.** An LLM never
  acts on the cluster unilaterally. Read-only queries run immediately; scale/restart/delete/patch
  require a human `approve`.

Treat all retrieved cluster text (logs, events, ConfigMaps, user YAML) as **untrusted input** —
never embed it into a system prompt as instructions. This is the primary defense against indirect
prompt injection.

---

## Licensing

**There is nothing to sign.** No CLA, no DCO sign-off, no `git commit -s`, no box to tick, no
account to create, and nothing for an employer's legal team to review. Opening the pull
request is the whole contract, and nothing checks for a sign-off — so there is nothing you can
get wrong.

Your contribution is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later, the same licence as the project, under
GitHub's Terms of Service for contributions to a licensed repository. [`DCO.md`](DCO.md)
explains the reasoning and the trade-off in full.

**You keep the copyright in your work.** Your contribution is licensed under AGPL-3.0-or-later, the
same license as the rest of the project, and you can keep using your own code anywhere else you like.

KubeIntellect is dual-licensed — AGPL-3.0-or-later, or a commercial license from the copyright holder
(see [LICENSING.md](LICENSING.md)). That commercial option covers the maintainer's own code. It does
not reach your contribution, and nothing here asks you to let it.

Questions about any of this? **Open a Discussion** — we would rather adapt than lose your work.

---

## Commit & PR style

- Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) where you can:
  `feat(kube-q): …`, `fix(server): …`, `docs: …`, `test: …`, `refactor: …`.
- Keep PRs focused — one logical change. Split unrelated refactors out.
- Describe the *why*, not just the *what*.

---

## Recognition

Every contributor is a real contributor, and **code is not the only kind that counts** — nor is
merging the bar. The [contributor table](README.md#contributors) records anyone who has moved
the project forward, including people whose work is still in progress — several people on it
have no merged commit at all. Claim an issue and you are added that day, marked 🛠️, and nobody
is ever removed.

These are credited by name in release notes with equal weight:

- Documentation, examples, and tutorials
- Bug reports with a reproduction that actually reproduces
- Issue triage and answering questions in Discussions
- Testing on a platform, distribution, or cloud the maintainer doesn't have
- Design feedback and RFC review
- Translations
- Playbooks and detectors

If you contributed and weren't credited, that's a mistake on our side — **open an issue and
we'll fix it.** You will not be the one being awkward.

Where this leads is written down in [GOVERNANCE.md](GOVERNANCE.md): there is an explicit
contributor ladder, and people are invited up it. The project has one maintainer today, so if
you want to own an area, that door is genuinely open.

Thank you for helping build a safer way to operate Kubernetes with AI. 💙
