# Chat with your Kubernetes cluster in plain English

**KubeIntellect** is an AI-powered Kubernetes management platform.
Describe a problem — a `CrashLoopBackOff`, a pending pod, an RBAC error — and a
multi-agent LLM system diagnoses it, proposes a fix, shows you a dry-run diff,
and waits for your approval before touching anything.

!!! info "This is KubeIntellect v1 — the capability-maximal generation"
    v1 is the original architecture: a LangGraph **Supervisor + 13 specialised agents**
    with runtime **CodeGenerator** tool synthesis, a LibreChat UI, and an MCP server.
    Later generations deliberately simplified this design — v2 (a lean 4-tool coordinator),
    v3 (a `deepagents` reframing), and v4 (the current platform with a memory hierarchy,
    autonomy ladder, and flight recorder). See the
    [project README](https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect) for the full v1→v5 lineage.

## Why KubeIntellect?

<div class="grid cards" markdown>

-   :material-magnify: **Root Cause Analysis**

    ---

    Correlates logs, metrics, events, and resource config **in parallel** — not just a log
    dump. Surfaces the actual cause, not a list of things to check.

-   :material-shield-check: **Human-in-the-Loop by Design**

    ---

    Every write operation produces a dry-run diff and pauses for your explicit approval.
    No unreviewed changes on live clusters — ever.

-   :material-graph: **Multi-Agent Orchestration**

    ---

    13 specialized agents (Logs, RBAC, Metrics, Security, Lifecycle, CodeGenerator, …) routed
    by a Supervisor LLM via LangGraph StateGraph.

-   :material-code-braces-box: **Dynamic Tool Generation**

    ---

    Need a capability that doesn't exist yet? KubeIntellect generates Python tools, sandboxes
    them, and registers them for reuse — all with your approval.

-   :material-brain: **Persistent Memory**

    ---

    Per-user context: sticky namespace, routing lessons, 30 pre-seeded failure patterns,
    and preference learning across sessions.

-   :material-swap-horizontal: **LLM-Agnostic**

    ---

    Azure OpenAI, OpenAI, Anthropic Claude, Google Gemini, AWS Bedrock, Ollama, LiteLLM —
    swap providers with a single env var.

## See It in Action

=== ":material-bug: Diagnose a crash"

    ```text
    > Why is my payment-api pod crashing in the prod namespace?

    Fetching logs, events, and resource config in parallel...

    Root cause: OOMKilled — container hit the 256Mi memory limit.
    Last 3 events: BackOff restarts (5m ago, 3m ago, 1m ago).

    Recommendation: increase memory limit to 512Mi.
    Dry-run diff ready — confirm to apply? [approve / deny]
    ```

=== ":material-shield-account: Audit RBAC"

    ```text
    > Who has cluster-admin access?

    3 service accounts hold cluster-admin:
      • default/tiller           (inactive — consider revoking)
      • kube-system/admin-sa     (system — expected)
      • kubeintellect/core-sa    (this platform — expected)

    Tiller is a known attack surface. Show remediation steps?
    ```

=== ":material-tools: Generate a tool"

    ```text
    > I need a tool that shows pods sorted by restart count

    No matching tool in registry. Generating...

    [HITL] Review generated code before registration? [approve / deny]
    [approve]

    Tool registered as 'list_pods_by_restart_count'. Running now:
      pod/api-6d4f9b       14 restarts
      pod/worker-2          3 restarts
      pod/scheduler-1       0 restarts
    ```

=== ":material-scale-balance: Scale with approval"

    ```text
    > Scale down all staging deployments to 0 replicas overnight

    I'll scale the following (dry-run diff attached):
      api      3 → 0 replicas
      worker   2 → 0 replicas
      cron     1 → 0 replicas

    Confirm? [approve / deny]
    ```

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone & configure
git clone https://github.com/MSKazemi/kubeintellect
cd kubeintellect
cp .env.example .env       # fill in LLM credentials

# 2. Deploy to local Kind cluster (full setup in one command)
make kind-kubeintellect-clean-deploy

# 3. Access the UI
make port-forward-librechat  # → http://localhost:3080
```

!!! tip "Fastest path"
    Run `make kind-kubeintellect-clean-deploy` — it creates the Kind cluster,
    generates secrets from `.env`, builds the image, and deploys via Helm.
    Total time: ~5 minutes on first run.

See [Installation](installation.md) for Azure AKS, N1, or other targets.
