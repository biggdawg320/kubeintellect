# ever mounted it: there was no /metrics endpoint, and app/api/middleware.py already excluded
# /metrics from request logging as though one existed. The control plane that watches everyone
# else's workloads was the one workload nobody could see — no request rate, no latency
# histogram, no error ratio, so an operator could not answer "is KubeIntellect itself healthy?"
# with anything better than a liveness probe that checks nothing by design.
#
# Unauthenticated on purpose: Prometheus scrapes it, and a scrape target that needs a bearer
# token is a target that silently stops being scraped when the token rotates. It exposes request
# counts and latencies only -- no cluster data, no prompts, no credentials. Restrict it with the
# NetworkPolicy, which is the layer that can actually express "only the monitoring namespace".
# The import is guarded because it was NOT guarded, and that cost a release: 2.4.0 shipped
# with `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator` declared only under the `metrics` extra while
# METRICS_ENABLED defaults to True, so `pip install kubeintellect` followed by
# `kubeintellect serve` died here with ModuleNotFoundError before uvicorn ever bound a port.
# It is now a core dependency as well, but the guard stays: a control plane must not refuse
# to boot because a telemetry package is absent. Missing metrics is a degradation; missing
# server is an outage.
