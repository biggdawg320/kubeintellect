"""The lines in a tool result that are *about* the result rather than part of it.

Two shapes, both written by the tools themselves: a `[Protected]` refusal or withheld-namespace
sentence from `namespace_guard`, and a truncation marker a tool appended after capping its own
output. Both live at the **end** of a listing — which is exactly where every downstream bound
cuts — and neither looks like an "important row" to any keep-pattern. So every layer between a
tool and a model has to carry them across its own trim; otherwise the guarantee the tool just
made is one that only its own return value keeps, and the model reads a short listing as a
complete one.

The regex is shared rather than copied because the two layers that need it (`coordinator.
_trim_tool_output` and `cortex.graph._bound_tool_content`) are eight hundred lines and one
package apart, and a pair of drifting copies of *this* predicate fails in the one direction
that is silent.
