"""A command must not report success for a subprocess whose result it never looked at.

`subprocess.run(..., check=False)` with the result thrown away is silent by construction: the
command fails, Python continues to the next line, and the next line is usually a `✓`. Four of
these were live in `kubeintellect`: `kind-setup` printed a table of five RCA scenarios that
kubectl had refused to create, printed "Sample pods deployed" over an empty namespace,
`service uninstall` printed "Service removed" while the server was still running, and
`kubeintellect set` printed "service restarted to apply changes" for a restart systemd never
performed — the last one being the only signal a user gets that new configuration took effect.

Reviewing the four sites fixes those four. This file is what stops the fifth being written: a
discarded result is allowed only when it appears in `_REVIEWED`, next to the reason it is safe.
